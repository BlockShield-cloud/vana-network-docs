## Block Explorer

{% hint style="success" %}
Available at: [https://satori.vanascan.io](https://satori.vanascan.io/txs)
{% endhint %}

A block explorer is a web-based tool that allows users to view details about blocks, transactions, addresses, and other activities on a blockchain network. Block explorers provide a user-friendly interface for accessing blockchain data, making it easier to track transactions, monitor network activity, and verify information without needing to run a full node.

## Token Faucet

{% hint style="success" %}
Available at: [https://faucet.vana.org/](https://faucet.vana.org/)
{% endhint %}

To begin testing on the testnet, a faucet can send free tokens on the test network to your wallet so you can register a DLP or a validator node. The faucet is rate-limited, and only a small amount of tokens will be available to be sent daily to a wallet.
