# Contribute Data

Testnet participants can access DLPs and contribute their individual data. Each DLP might have their own requirements, what data is required, how to contribute this data and what specific rewards users will receive

Some DLPs have a frontend interface for data contributors to add their data. Other DLPs do not have a frontend interface and require data contributors to write their data contribution transactions on their own.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
All testnet data will **not** be migrated to mainnet. Do not expect that your data added to the testnet will be available on mainnet.

Uploading real data to testnet is for testing purposes only. No tokens have value on testnet.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Please join our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/xfGrYrjw)to get an overview over all existing DLPs and how to access them.
