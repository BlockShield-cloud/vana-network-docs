# What is Vana?

Vana is the first network for user-owned data. It is designed for users to own their data and the value it creates. For more context on why we built Vana, see this [blog post](https://www.vana.org/posts/introducing-the-satori-testnet).&#x20;

At its core, Vana is a data liquidity network. It makes data liquid by solving the double spend problem for data, ensuring that data is not used multiple times without the owner's consent. This is achieved through two mechanisms: proof-of-contribution and non-custodial data. Proof-of-contribution verifies the value of private data in a privacy-preserving manner, while non-custodial data ensures that the data is only used for approved operations.

Vana aligns incentives between data owners, developers, and data consumers. It creates a data-powered economy owned by its participants rather than centralized entities. Our guiding use case is a user-owned foundation model collectively owned and created by 100M users.&#x20;

To participate in the network, you can:&#x20;

* [Start a data liquidity pool (DLP)](quick-start-guide/satori-testnet/create-a-data-liquidity-pool-dlp.md)
* [Run a validator](quick-start-guide/satori-testnet/become-a-dlp-validator.md)
* [Contribute data](quick-start-guide/satori-testnet/contribute-data.md)

### Data Ownership Problem

We live under data serfdom, where we create valuable data and see no economic upside in the value we've helped create.

OpenAI_,_ Meta, and Google all train models on publicly scraped data from the searchable internet, and are starting to buy up private data as they need access to more training data. Reddit for example, earns $200M from selling user-generated content as AI training data. As AI starts to play a larger and larger economic role in society, the economic impact of this data will grow.&#x20;

We risk heading towards a future where AI models trained on our data displace us, with the economic gains flowing to a small set of shareholders. At the same time, we hold all the power through our data, but it requires collective action.

We believe that you should own a piece of the AI models that your data helps create.

### Goal

Our goal is to empower users to own their data and the value it creates. We believe data will power the AI economic shift over the next decade. Giving users true ownership of their data opens up walled gardens pushes AI progress forward through data abundance.

We apply the sovereign, decentralized technology that powers bitcoin and ethereum to personal data, shifting power from monopolistic big tech and distributing it back into the hands of the users who created the data. Vana provides the infrastructure to generate user-owned datasets that can replicate and supersede the datasets that big tech companies are today selling for hundreds of millions of dollars.

#### _**We’re creating the world's largest user-owned data treasury—a resource so valuable that the world’s leading AI models will be built upon it.**_
