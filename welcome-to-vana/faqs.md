# FAQs

## Is a data DAO the same as a data liquidity pool?

Data liquidity pools allow any group to come together and pool similar data, with data quality secured by proof-of-contribution. A data DAO is like a labor union for data, where users collectively pool their data and govern what happens to it. It is a specific form of a data liquidity pool that uses a dataset-specific token to govern the use of the data. Some data liquidity pools may choose not to create a new token, and instead use a stablecoin with payments that go out to data contributors.

## How competitive will it be to earn one of the 16 slots?

Earning one of the 16 slots on Vana's mainnet for Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) is designed to be competitive to ensure only the highest quality and most valuable DLPs are included. Factors that will affect the competitiveness include:

* Quality of Data: The value and usefulness of the data your DLP can provide.
* Community Support: Strong backing and engagement from the Vana community.
* Performance Metrics: Your DLP's performance on testnet, including total transactions facilitated, transaction fees created, number of verified data uploads, and unique wallet interactions.

On mainnet, DLPs are elected by the native token holders.

## If I invest time in building out the DLP, will it pay off?

Investing time and resources into building a DLP can be highly rewarding. The benefits include:

* Block Rewards: Elected DLPs are eligible for block rewards early on.
* Priority Access: Guaranteed access to Vana's limited DLP slots on mainnet.
* Fundraising Support: Access to international and US fundraising support, including introductions to Vana's backers like Paradigm and Polychain.
* AI Project Bootstrap: Use token incentives to raise capital and gather data for your AI projects.

## Can I start on Testnet without a live token?

Yes, you can start developing and testing your DLP on the testnet without a live token. This phase allows you to refine your DLP's functionality and performance metrics without the pressure of live network operations. Once your DLP proves its viability and value on the testnet, you can move forward with the token integration and mainnet deployment.

## What criteria will DLPs be evaluated on to earn a slot on mainnet?

To earn a slot on the mainnet, DLPs will be evaluated based on several performance metrics and community involvement:

* Total Transactions Facilitated (TTF): The volume of transactions your DLP handles.
* Total Transaction Fees (TFC): The gas costs generated by your DLP.
* Verified Data Uploads (VDU): The number of data uploads that meet verification criteria.
* Unique Wallets Interaction (UW): The number of unique wallets interacting with your DLP.
* Community Voting: DLP proposals must pass community votes on platforms like Snapshot.

## How do I get started to build a DLP?

1. Develop Your DLP: Build your DLP smart contracts and test them on the devnet.
2. Acquire $DAT: Obtain at least 100 $DAT to meet proposal submission requirements.
3. Submit Proposal: Present your DLP proposal to the governance forum and Snapshot for community voting.
4. Engage with the Community: Join Vanaâ€™s Discord server to gather support and feedback.
5. Deploy and Test: Finalize your DLP on the testnet and prepare for mainnet launch.
