# What criteria will DLPs be evaluated on to earn a slot on mainnet?

To earn a slot on the mainnet, DLPs will be evaluated based on several performance metrics and community involvement:

* Total Transactions Facilitated (TTF): The volume of transactions your DLP handles.
* Total Transaction Fees (TFC): The gas costs generated by your DLP.
* Verified Data Uploads (VDU): The number of data uploads that meet verification criteria.
* Unique Wallets Interaction (UW): The number of unique wallets interacting with your DLP.
* Community Voting: DLP proposals must pass community votes on platforms like Snapshot.
