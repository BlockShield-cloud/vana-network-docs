# How competitive will it be to earn one of the 16 slots?

Earning one of the 16 slots on Vana's mainnet for Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) is designed to be competitive to ensure only the highest quality and most valuable DLPs are included. Factors that will affect the competitiveness include:

* Quality of Data: The value and usefulness of the data your DLP can provide.
* Community Support: Strong backing and engagement from the Vana community.
* Performance Metrics: Your DLP's performance on testnet, including total transactions facilitated, transaction fees created, number of verified data uploads, and unique wallet interactions.

On mainnet, DLPs are elected by the native token holders.&#x20;
