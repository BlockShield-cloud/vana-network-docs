# Data Ownership FAQ

#### Hasn't crypto solved digital ownership? Why doesn't it work for data ownership, too?&#x20;

While existing layer one blockchains have enabled digital ownership and liquid markets for assets like art, collectibles, and financial instruments, private data has two unique properties that make it more challenging to apply the same solutions:

1. Data is non-excludable, so as soon as you make it public, it can be copied any number of times. We call this the "data double spend problem"
2. Data is heterogeneous, but must be aggregated in order to be valuable as AI training data.

Vana is designed to solve the data double spend problem by allowing data contributors to contribute to AI models without revealing their underlying data, and designed to enable data liquidity through data liquidity pools.&#x20;

#### Why does data ownership help me as a builder?&#x20;

Sometimes, data ownership is associated with slowing technological progress. We want to accelerate progress, not hinder it. We believe that true data ownership unlocks better AI, as it allows for new training datasets that wouldn't otherwise be available. Proper attribution and incentives can enable frontier AI models collectively owned and governed by those who contribute to them.&#x20;

Data portability also levels the playing field by allowing builders to access cross-platform data, enabling healthy competition for data-based products.&#x20;

#### Why haven't any data ownership projects succeeded yet?

Data ownership projects have taken a very ideological approach and generally remained academic or esoteric projects, even bordering on performance art. We believe in a pragmatic, full-stack approach to building infrastructure that gets real adoption, and have been progressively decentralizing our system over the past three years. We have built end-user facing products that onboarded over 1M users and know that building a successful protocol requires adoption. We started with a data portability API that we rolled out in a centralized way to start getting adoption of the system, and have contributed to viral user-owned data apps to show their success, including vana portrait. It was upon this infrastructure that the worldâ€™s first Data DAO was built, attracting hundreds of thousands of participants in just a few days.&#x20;
