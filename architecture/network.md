Vana consists of a Data Liquidity Layer, designed to introduce data onchain as transferable digital assets, and an Application Layer for user-owned data applications powered by verified data. The universal connectome is a permissionless, real-time map of data flowing through the ecosystem.

### Data Liquidity Layer

The Data Liquidity Layer is where data is contributed, validated, and recorded to the network into data liquidity pools (DLPs). Here, DLP creators deploy DLP smart contracts with specific data contribution objectives, including the DLP’s purpose, validation method, and data contribution parameters.

In the Data Liquidity Layer, data contributors and custodians submit data to DLPs for validation and receive both governance rights and rewards for their data contributions based on parameters set out in the DLP validation process.

The purpose of the Data Liquidity Layer is to bring data onchain and facilitate data transactions among Data Contributors, Custodians, and DLP Validators. This network layer organizes all data collection and management for user and developer accessibility throughout the ecosystem.

#### Data Liquidity Pools

Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs) aggregate similar types of data submitted to the data liquidity layer by Data Contributors and Custodians. Each DLP is an individual peer-to-peer network that uses DLP Validators to ensure data integrity through Vana’s proof-of-contribution system. DLPs provide trustless, private, and attributable data liquidity pools from which users and developers can:

* Govern the use of their data in model training and application development.
* Build community-focused applications in Vana’s application layer.
* Sell data liquidity access to Data Consumers for model training.

### Application Layer

The Application Layer is an open data playground for Data Contributors and developers to collaborate and build applications with the data liquidity amassed by DLPs. As the Data Liquidity Layer verifiably brings data onchain, the Application Layer provides the infrastructure for the distributed training of user-owned foundation models and the development of novel AI dApps.

The Application Layer functions as an active data hub, where online communities can collaborate with developers to create real economic value from their data. This fosters an interactive data creation ecosystem, where data contributors benefit from the downstream network effects and value emerging from the intelligence that their data helps to create.

#### **Personal Servers**

Vana uses a personal server architecture to allow users and data collectives to store private information offchain. Personal servers allow users to train models on their personal data in a secure local environment. Urbit and Solid Project were the first to pioneer this architecture. Vana uses it specifically for private, personal data storage. To run your personal server, get started [here](https://github.com/vana-com).&#x20;

### Connectome

Connectome is a network over-layer that validates real-time data transactions throughout Vana’s ecosystem. Using proof-of-stake consensus, Connectome propogators propagate data transactions within the network. This ensures that DLP token transfers are valid and allows for cross-DLP data access by user-owned data applications.&#x20;

Functioning like a block explorer for data, Connectome allows external parties to view and monitor data transactions throughout the network. Moreover, Connectome is EVM-compatible allowing for interoperability with other EVM networks, protocols, and DeFi applications.
