# Glossary

### **Connectome**

A network overlay validating real-time data transactions within [Vanaâ€™s](glossary.md#vana) ecosystem, ensuring cross-[DLP](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp) data access and interoperability with other networks.

### **Data Consumer**

An entity that queries [DLPs](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp) to access high-quality datasets for purposes such as AI model training, paying with pool tokens that are burned upon transaction.

### **Data Contributor**

A user who submits data to [DLPs](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp), adhering to set standards, and receives rewards for valuable data contributions.

### **Data Custodian**

An entity that hosts and facilitates data contributions, ensuring compliance with regulations and providing encryption to protect data privacy.

### **Data Liquidity Layer**

The layer where data is contributed, validated, and recorded into [data liquidity pools (DLPs)](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp), facilitating [data transactions](glossary.md#data-transaction).

### **Data Liquidity Pool (DLP)**

An aggregation of similar data assets within the [Vana](glossary.md#vana) network, operating as a peer-to-peer network with [validators](glossary.md#validator) ensuring data integrity and quality.

### **Data Transaction**

Submissions to the [Vana network](glossary.md#vana) including metadata and encrypted storage locations, ensuring [contributors](glossary.md#data-contributor) retain control over their data.

### **DLP Smart Contract**

Contracts deployed within [DLPs](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp) that handle the [validation](glossary.md#validator) and [consensus](glossary.md#nagoya-consensus) process for [data contributions.](glossary.md#data-contributor)

### **Model Influence Function**

A function measuring the impact of a data contribution on a machine learning model's performance, used within the [Proof of Contribution](glossary.md#proof-of-contribution-poc) system.

### **Nagoya Consensus**

A mechanism incentivizing [validators](glossary.md#validator) to agree on data quality and value within a [DLP](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp), rewarding those whose evaluations align with others.

### **Non-Custodial Data Portability**

A feature allowing users to move their data and models across applications without interference, ensuring privacy and censorship resistance.

### **Personal Server**

A user-operated server storing private data off-chain, enabling secure local training of models without exposing raw data.

### **Proof of Contribution (PoC)**

A system validating the integrity and quality of data within [DLPs](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp) using validators who evaluate and score data contributions.

### **Propagator**

A network participant responsible for writing data transactions to the blockchain, maintaining network consensus, and earning fees for their work.

### **Root Network**

The governance layer overseeing[ DLPs](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp), distributing rewards, and ensuring network compliance.

### **State**

The current information about the [DLP](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp), including node status, scores, and block numbers.

### **User-Owned Foundation Model**

A collaborative model governed by [data-contributing](glossary.md#data-contributor) users, where each user trains part of the model on their [personal server](glossary.md#personal-server) and is rewarded based on their contribution.

### **Validator**&#x20;

A participant who verifies data authenticity and quality within a [DLP](glossary.md#data-liquidity-pool-dlp), rewarded for accurate evaluations and governed by the [Nagoya Consensus ](glossary.md#nagoya-consensus)mechanism.

### **Vana**

A decentralized data liquidity network enabling users to own and monetize their data through a trustless open data economy.
